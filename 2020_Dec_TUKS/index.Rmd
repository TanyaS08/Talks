# What is Open Science?

.center[*A global movement to promote integrity, repeatability, and transparency across all aspects of scientific research*]

???

+ first thing that comes to mind is probably OA pubblishing
--

.pull-left[
**Which includes (but is not limited to):**

- Open access to publications
- Open access to data
- Open source code and data handling
  + focusing on **reproducability**
]

--

.pull-right[**Reproducability** = being able to get the same results using the same *analysis* and same *data*
]

???

+ Have you ever thought why there is this movement towards using R and gaving to go through the frustration/tears of learning that on top of new statistical methods???
+ mention here that as mostly R users taking a BIG step in the right direction

# OS and the Data Lifecycle

.center[Open Science can help extend the lifespan of a dataset e.g. by allowing it to be reused for data synthesis or re-analysis
]

--
.center[
<img src="img/DataLifecycle.png" width="78%" />
]

--

.center[
But in order for this to happen your data need to be **usable**
]

---

# Make your Science FAIR

.center[***F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eproducible*]

.pull-left[

* Sharing data is the first step but not the only one

* [**FAIR**](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) principles focus on data (re)usability

* Data are only as good as their documentation

]

--

.pull-right[
<img src="img/FairGremlins.png" width="70%" />
]

# So What?

+ Open Science will be the 'new normal' and is becoming an expectation for publication and funding

+ Open data leads to increased citations

???

+ from a career prespective


--

+ It fosters collaboration and opens doors for what we can achieve with our research

+ It makes your (personal) workflow easier (especially for future you) **and** makes for easier collaborative work/writing
  + The little bit of extra time is worth it - trust me
  
???

+ from a more 'philosophical' perspective

???

in terms of future you thinking yourself -> its more of a re-allocation of time and that re-allocation also makes your date more 'open'

# A Quick Case Study<sub style="font-size: medium;">(on what not to do)</sub>


.left-column[

* My honours file naming 'system'

* The 'amazing' documentation

* To quote the lobster from the *Little Mermaid* "it's a mess"

]

.right-column[
<img src="img/case_study.png" width="100%" />
]

???

+ this is my current reality at the moment since we want to try and publish this now
+ I can semi follow what is going on - imagine I sent this to any one of you and asked if you could have a look at things

# Where to Start Though?


.left-column[
<img src="img/DataLifecycle_vert.png" width="100%" />
]


--

.footnote[[*] Respecting data sharing restrictions and embargoes]

.right-column[
- Think about how you enter your data
  * Follow data and metadata standards (e.g. [DarwinCore](https://www.tdwg.org/))
  * Document **everything** 


- Document data processing and analysis
  * Use code-based workflows
  * Annotate said code
  
  
- Archive data/code in an accessible way
  * Make as open and findable as possible<sup>*</sup> e.g a doi for files
      * [OSF](https://osf.io) 
      * [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)
  * See [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097) for some more tips

# If it isn't Documented it Doesn't Exist

**Document all changes to raw data**
+ Ideally after inputting your data into a file<sup>*</sup> that file should remain unchanged. 
  + Data cleaning should be scripted
+ Using a script based workflow means you keep track of what and how things changed

.footnote[[*] Ideally using a non propriety format such as .csv or .txt]

.pull-right[<img src="img/interoperable.png" width="70%" />]

.pull-left[
**Document the *entire* workflow**
+ Having metadata for variables - that's good
  + Mandatory I'd argue
+ Documenting how scripts 'work' - even better

.center[
Annotating your code by adding comments makes it easier for you (and others) to understand what or why you decided to do what you did
]

???

+ and ties in well with documentation

--

.pull-left[
- Annotations double up as pseudocode
  
  
- Detail specific changes or reasoning
  * Especially when cleaning or transforming data
  ]

???

+ this not gives 'credibility' to your work but also makes it more accessible for those that maybe don't hace the same statistical/programming language background as you e.g. Julia

---

# Get with GitHub

.center[
Think of GitHub your normal documents folder(s) - the only difference is that it has some bonus features.
]

* It has **Version Control:** This means that every time you re-upload a file the older versions are saved.
  + You can do the 'uploading' & 'downloading' [straight from RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)
  + Everyone has the most up to date version on their device - *no more email chain!*
  
???

+ you can also restore to previous versions
+ introduce the idea of pusing and pulling
+ commit comments also help with keeping track of changes

--

* It makes for easy **archiving** and **sharing**. Projects are hosted in repositories in the public domain.
  + Drop the link and everyone has read access
  + It's designed with documentation and hosting in mind
  
  
--

* It's **designed for programming:** Aside form simple storage of files you can design [workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions) that run jobs depending on what happens in the repository.

???

+ for the excited user

# GitHub: Fast facts

1. GitHub is the 'norm' in the world of Open Source  - so if you want to go open go with GitHub

1. [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com) is a great starting point if you're interested
  + especially for installing Git on your device (it's not as confusing as they make it out to be though)

1. You can also have private repositories
  * So you can keep your work 'hidden' but still cash in on version control and easier collaborating
  
1. As university students you qualify for a [free pro account](https://education.github.com/pack) - *go for it*

---
# To Summarise

1. Demonstrating an ethos of Open Science practice makes you a more competitive applicant for funding/jobs

1. Future you will thank you when you need to re-run an analyses later 

1. Being reproducible lands credibility - it shows that you back your data/methods and *encourages* re-checking of things

1. You are contributing to the greater collective knowledge and helping reshape how we do science

1. Social media is another tool you can use
  + Twitter has a big OS community and is a great way to get connected - [Twitter for Scientists](https://t4scientists.com/) is a good starting point

1. You can start one bite at a time - it takes time to find what works, so take it project-by-project (and something is better than nothing)

???

+ emphasise that even I am still learning/just starting out and as coders they are well on their way
