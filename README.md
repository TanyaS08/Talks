# Talks

Slides are created using [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) in RStudo - slides are rendered in .html format and can be viewed in any browser. If you have the file downloaded this can also be hosted locally on your machine.

## Navigating Presentations

* Previous slide = press `Up/Left` arrows, `PageUp`, or `k`.

* Next slide = press `Right/Down` arrows, `PageDown`, `Space`, or `j`.

* Typing a number and pressing Return (or Enter), you can jump to a specific slide with that page number.

* `b` blacks out a slide, and `m` “mirrors” it.

* `f` toggles fullscreen mode.

* Press `c` to clone the slides to a new browser window; slides in the two windows will be in sync as you navigate through them. 

* Press `p` to toggle the presenter mode. Pressing `t` restarts the timer.

* Press `h` or `?` for the help page.
